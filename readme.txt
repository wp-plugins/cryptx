== Description ==

No more SPAM by spiders scanning you site for email adresses. With CryptX you can hide all your email adresses, 
with and without a mailto-link, by converting them using javascript or UNICODE. Although you can choose to add 
a mailto-link to all unlinked email adresses with only one klick at the settings. That's great, isn't it?
